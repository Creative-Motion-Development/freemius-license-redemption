A complete redemption widget for AppSumo Codes for Freemius.

![screenshot](https://github.com/Creative-Motion-Development/freemius-license-redemption/blob/master/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

What this does:
- People can redeem a Freemius license key
- The user's email, name, and is_marketing_allowed fields are sent, but nothing is stored on the site.
- When an error occurs (e.g. invalid license key) it will be alerted out for simplicity

# Install

1. Add plugin
- Select the `Master branch -> Code button -> Download ZIP`
- Install the plugin via the Wordpress installer: Plugins -> Add New
OR Unzip the archive to the `wp-content/plugins` folder.
- Activate it.

2. Add all settings (connections to Freemius) in `Settings -> Freemius License Redemption`
3. Add a shortcode `[wflr_form plugin_id='1234']` to any page on your site. `plugin_id` - is the plugin ID in the Freemius.
